Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game! This is a simple command-line version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python.

## How to Play

2. Players take turns to make their move by entering a number from 1 to 9 corresponding to the position on the board.
3. The game alternates between Player X and Player O.
4. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
5. If the board is filled with no winner, the game ends in a tie.
